# TextBase-Titans-Hackathon

Track 1: Chatbot Development & Deployment
Along with given examples from the previous Mercor Chatbot Challenge code functionalities, I am adding 3 more functionalities that makes chatbot unique based on my perspective.
1. Product Recommendation Feature:
To create a product recommender chatbot, you can use a function to handle product recommendations based on user preferences. I’ve added a simplified implementation using dummy product data.
2. Language Translation Assistant:
A chatbot that can translate text between multiple languages. It could be used for real-time language translation in conversations, making it useful for travellers or international business communication.
To add language translation capabilities in chatbot, I’ve used Google Translate, translation API.
3. Mental Health Support Bot:
Chatbot that offers mental health support, including mood tracking, coping strategies, and resources for users facing stress or emotional challenges.
To offer mental health support, I’ve created functions for mood tracking, coping strategies, and resources.
4. Travel Planner and Booking Bot:
Assistance users get while planning trips, finding accommodations, booking flights, and providing travel recommendations using a chatbot.
By keeping it simple, I have added some recommend travel destinations as well.
Main.py code includes all four functionalities: product recommendations, language translation, mood tracking, and GPT-3.5 Turbo responses, all within the on_message function. I’ve integrated them as separate functions within the on_message function of openai bot.
